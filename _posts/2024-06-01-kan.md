## KAN and MLP

The emergence of the KAN model has led to heated discussions in the AI community, and the reason for this is that the flaws in the structure of the MLP itself have been troubling the researchers involved. Nowadays, most AI research is based on MLP. The appearance of KAN can potentially revolutionize the direction of AI research. If KAN is as marvelous as expected in subsequent research, its appearance will be like the emergence of cement in a society that has been only using wood to build houses.
